    "The first step to any data analysis project is to define the question or problem we're looking to solve, and to define a measure (or set of measures) for our success at solving that task. The data analysis checklist has us answer a handful of questions to accomplish that, so let's work through those questions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's do that now. Since we're performing classification, we can use [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision) — the fraction of correctly classified flowers — to quantify how well our model is performing. Our company's Head of Data has told us that we should achieve at least 90% accuracy.\n",

    "We're building part of a data analysis pipeline for a smartphone app that will be able to classify the species of flowers from pictures taken on the smartphone.

    ">Did you record the experimental design?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our company's Head of Data has told us that the field researchers are hand-measuring 50 randomly-sampled flowers of each species using a standardized methodology. The field researchers take pictures of each flower they sample from pre-defined angles so the measurements and species can be confirmed by the other field researchers at a later point. At the end of each day, the data is compiled and stored on a private company GitHub repository.\n",

    "\n",
    "The data set we currently have is only for three types of *Iris* flowers. The model built off of this data set will only work for those *Iris* flowers, so we will need more data to create a general flower classifier.\n",
