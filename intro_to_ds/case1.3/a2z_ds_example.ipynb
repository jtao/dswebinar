    "Let's do that now. Since we're performing classification, we can use [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision) — the fraction of correctly classified flowers — to quantify how well our model is performing.

The field researchers take pictures of each flower they sample from pre-defined angles so the measurements and species can be confirmed by the other field researchers at a later point. At the end of each day, the data is compiled and stored on a private company GitHub repository.\n",
